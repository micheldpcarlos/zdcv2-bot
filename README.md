# zdcv2-bot
Simple JS bot to automate races, it checks one by one and start races automatically, skipping expired and cars that already did all runs.


:warning: Make sure you car has fuel, othewise it will break the bot :warning:
Refuel verification is not added to the bot yet (not sure if I will)


## How to use

1) Open your Zodiacs directly in /battlefield, if not go to /battlefield and refresh, to make sure there is no elements from other pages in the ui.

2) Open devtools (F12 or Cmd+Opt+J or Right Click on the page and Inspect)

3) Go to the Console Tab

4) Copy bot.js content, paste there and hit Enter

5) Now you can close DevTools, the bot is already running



:desktop_computer: Game window needs to be visible to avoid components not being rendered and breaking the bot

:x: If something goes wrong you can just refresh the page and start the bot again
